# hello-world
My first repository. Used for training purposes based on GitHub Guides "Hello World"

Readme file of my first repository. 

This repository was created as part of the "Hello World" Tutorial from GitHub Guides (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

I started learning python recently. I work as a postdoc in cell biology and would like to make use of available data in my field but also improve the management of data I obtain from my experiments (imaging mostly).
