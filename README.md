# hello-world
My first repository. Used for training purposes based on GitHub Guides "Hello World"

Readme file of my first repository. 

This repository was created as part of the "Hello World" Tutorial from GitHub Guides (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

I started learning python recently. I want to use it in future for data science, in particular for extracting relevant information for my work. I work as a postdoc in cell biology and would like to make use of the increasing amount of data available in this field.
